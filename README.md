# Online-Purchasing-Intention
This project deals with the major issue e-commerce website faces - will the user generate revenue or not?


In the past year, online buying has become popular. Forever 21 will eliminate 200 locations due to high
store lease costs, underperforming areas, and ongoing disruption from internet shopping. Customers
favor online shopping over traditional businesses because it is convenient and simple to shop around
from one's home or business. The customer's wants can be met with various products on an online
shop platform. The product will be delivered to a person's home or place of business after they have
access to the internet and make a digital payment. Customers may learn everything there is to know
about a product by reading the reviews that previous customers have left. They are now allowed to ask
their family and friends if they want to purchase a product because many product reviews on the web
give opinions of existing product users.
Online purchasing has several benefits, including comparing prices, 24/7 accessibility, and time and
energy savings. Online shopping was predicted to be done by 1.8 billion individuals in 2018. Global
e-retail sales reached 2.8 trillion dollars in the same year, and estimates indicate growth of up to 4.8
trillion dollars by 2021. Platforms for online purchasing include Amazon, Alibaba, Tokopedia, Rakuten,
and others. E-commerce businesses offer discounts, flash sales, and other promotions on essential
days like Christmas, Valentine's Day, the summer solstice, online shopping day, etc., to entice shoppers
to buy their products. The client's intention to shop online will rise on the promotion day. Online
shopping is a common daily activity for people today because it saves them time.

DATASET:

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that
each session would belong to a different user in 1 year to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign,
special day, user profile, or period. This dataset is a collection of 18 attributes/features, out of which
10 are Numerical Features, and the remaining 7 are Categorical Features that help predict the last
Categorical Feature, “Revenue,” which classifies whether an individual will do a transaction or not.
Each attribute is as follows:

● Administrative – Number of pages visited by the visitor about account management.
● Administrative Duration – Total amount of time (in seconds) the visitor spends on
account management-related pages.
● Informational – Number of pages visited by the visitor about a Web site, communication, and
address information of the shopping site.
● Information Durational – Total amount of time (in seconds) the visitor spends on
informational pages.
